# The Focus Zone
Project Description
===
The Focus Zone is a web application designed to improve productivity through the use of the pomodoro technique. Working and break times are split up into 25-5 minute intervals which are displayed with a digital stopwatch. At the moment there are 5 custom themes with unique background videos, and ambient noises aimed to increase focus.
